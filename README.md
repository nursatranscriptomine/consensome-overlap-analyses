# consensome-overlap-analyses
R code utilizing the GeneOverlap R package to analyze the overlap between your favorite gene list and Signaling Pathways Project (SPP) consensome high confidence targets (HCTs). This example shows overlap between HCTs for IAV, CoV_ALL, SARS1_ALL, SARS2_ALL, and MERS and a list of genes mapped to epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The object "gs" is the number genes in the universe.
